# airdrop.sh — send file(s) via the macOS AirDrop share window, from the terminal.
#
# Automates everything macOS allows: stages the files, opens the AirDrop
# window, exits the moment the session ends, and reports the outcome. Two
# actions stay human by OS design: picking the receiving device (sender side)
# and, between different Apple IDs, the Accept prompt (receiver side).
#
# Outcome detection (empirical, macOS 15/Darwin 24):
#   - NSSharingServiceDelegate is BLIND to cancel-vs-sent: didShareItems fires
#     identically for a completed transfer and for the Cancel button, and
#     willShareItems fires at window-open, not at recipient choice. So the
#     delegate only provides the fast exit, not the verdict.
#   - The verdict comes from sharingd's AfterFirstUseExpirationDate preference,
#     which advances when a transfer actually starts and stays put on Cancel
#     (verified: 3 real sends bumped it, 3 cancels did not). Undocumented key,
#     so an absent/unreadable value degrades to an honest CLOSED outcome
#     rather than a guess.
#
# Usage: airdrop.sh <file> [file...]
#   AIRDROP_KEEPALIVE=<seconds>  backstop timeout for an abandoned window
#                                (default 600). All interactive endings exit
#                                immediately regardless.
#
# Output (last line) / exit code:
#   SENT       0  transfer started and window closed normally
#   DISMISSED  1  window closed without a transfer (Cancel)
#   FAILED:..  1  sharing service reported an error
#   TIMEOUT:.. 1  nobody interacted with the window
#   CLOSED:..  2  window closed but this system offers no way to verify
